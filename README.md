# Heart Disease Prediction Using ECG

This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) data for classifying heart conditions into four categories:

- **Myocardial Infarction**
- **Abnormal Heartbeat**
- **History of Myocardial Infarction**
- **Normal Heartbeat**


### **Repository Under**: AcWoC'25  
### **Club**: Android Club, VIT Bhopal University  


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is located in the `Dataset` directory. It comprises ECG recordings labeled according to the aforementioned categories.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. 

```bash
please go through the notebook and install the reqd dependencies manually as the required dependecies are subject to change with time .
```

## Usage

The `Notebook` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes. To execute these notebooks:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the desired notebook from the `Notebook` directory.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model

The machine learning model implemented in this project is designed to classify ECG signals into one of the four specified categories. The model's architecture and training parameters are detailed within the Jupyter notebooks.

## Results

Evaluation metrics and results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, are presented in the notebooks. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance across different heart condition categories.
